        The web is today’s Main Street because it lets people visit businesses from anywhere.
        DNS works like street signs that guide a browser (client) to the server where the site lives.
        This client/server model keeps the storefront open 24/7 and creates constant reach.
        Hosting on GitHub Pages gives 39 Brand a fast, secure, no-cost presence over HTTPS.
